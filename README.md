## 👋 Hi, I’m Abdullah Omar

I’m a junior software developer with hands-on experience in full-stack web development and a growing focus on data analysis and machine learning.

I enjoy building real-world, production-ready systems and learning how software engineering, data, and system design work together to solve practical problems.
