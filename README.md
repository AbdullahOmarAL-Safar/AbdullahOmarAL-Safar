## 👋 Hi, I’m Abdullah Omar

I’m a junior software developer with hands-on experience in full-stack web development and a growing focus on data analysis and machine learning.

I enjoy building real-world, production-ready systems and learning how software engineering, data, and system design work together to solve practical problems.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Journey

I am currently transitioning into Machine Learning, with a focus on building strong foundations in supervised learning and data analysis.

I have completed **Supervised Machine Learning** by **Stanford University & DeepLearning.AI**, gaining practical understanding of:

- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Cost functions and gradient descent
- Feature scaling and data preprocessing
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Applying supervised learning using Python

At this stage, I focus on small, well-structured projects that emphasize clarity, correctness, and interpretability over complexity. I approach Machine Learning as a long-term discipline, prioritizing fundamentals before advancing to more complex models.
